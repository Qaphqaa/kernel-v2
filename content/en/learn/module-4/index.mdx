# ℹ️nternet age institutions

Right, we've taken back the web! Now what? 

It's time for a story. One summer's day in England, a fine young gentleman is out for a stroll, 
or to "take the air" as refined young English gentlemen say. On that fabled island, there is an 
old law called "Free Reign", which specifies that farmers must keep at least one path open to 
the public through their land in order that those so inclined might take the air uninterrupted. 
However, on this fateful day, our fine young English gent happens upon a fence blocking his path. 
He becomes annoyed that some peasant has dared spoil his wonderful stroll and so - with an air 
of legal, nay, _righteous_ justification - he kicks down the fence and proceeds. Of course, he 
is just as quickly trampled by the Brahmin bull in the field, whom the fence was preventing from 
escaping into some unsuspecting and ill-equipped English village.

This story is known as <Link to="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/" >Chesterton's Fence</Link> 
and has many versions, including a very beautiful one about a lamp, a monk, and the philosophy 
of <Link to="https://ciechanow.ski/lights-and-shadows/" >light</Link>. The moral is: 
don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand. Much like we first 
introduced [the subversive joy of Ethereum](/learn/module-1/) and then returned to a deeper 
understanding of [the current financial system](/learn/module-2/); now that we've looked at what 
it might mean to [reclaim the web](/learn/module-3/) as a creative and collaborative commons, we 
must go back and understand more clearly what kinds of institutions we may need to keep our 
world wide web safe to walk through gaily. 

## Convivial Customs

That said, institutions need not be things like The Federal Reserve, or a government department, or a place you go when you need to spend some time separate from society. We have - for instance - the institution of marriage: which is a **practice** or a **custom**. It is in this sense which we will be using the word for the rest of Module 4.

This approach is similar to [extitutional theory](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53), which contrasts enclosure with the concept of **exclosure**, recognizing that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control. Understanding the practices and social customs that make up extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logics of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our era.

This is because the internet routes information around slow-moving bureaucracies and so requires that we develop a deeper understanding of the many ways we can relate to one another and **organize ourselves**. In particular, the internet has caused - and will continue to cause - critical shifts in three spheres of human life: how we identify ourselves, how we reach consensus, and how we experience time. Cast in the language of anarchy - which really means no rulers, not no rules - these views of institution-as-practice or custom can be collected under the term <Link to="https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf">"counterpower"</Link>:

> Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ways of publicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and transforming it into social states (or if you like, forms of value) that society sees as the most desirable: conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity, beauty, however it may be framed.

In particular, we will make the claim this week that we can indeed [build for beauty](https://www.buildingbeauty.org/beautiful-software). We can co-create patterns which lead each one of us closer to the unhindered perception of what Christopher Alexander calls "true Self". In another classic interplay of complementary opposites, pattern languages which cultivate such intimately personal perception are inherently communal and, as such, lead us back to custom and conviviality. In concert with Alexander, we can turn to Ivan Illich for an illuminating perspective on these critical words, **commons** and **custom**:

> The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. **Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.**
