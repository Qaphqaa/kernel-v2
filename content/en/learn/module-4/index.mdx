# ℹ️nternet age institutions

Much like we first introduced [the subversive joy of Ethereum](/learn/module-1/) and then returned to a deeper understanding of [the current financial system](/learn/module-2/); now that we've looked at what it might mean to [reclaim the web](/learn/module-3/) as a creative and collaborative commons, we 
must go back and understand more clearly how we wish to go on instituting this world wide web of light we share. 

> "Fundamental social change must begin with a change of consciousness about institutions [...] a viable future turns on the rejuvenation of institutional style [...] At stake in the choice between institutions is the very nature of human life. We must choose whether to be rich in things or in the freedom to use them. The choice between sad unemployment and joyful leisure is now open for the entire culture [...] The radically alternative way to fill available time is a limited range of more durable goods and providing access to institutions which can **increase the opportunity and desirability of human interaction.**" -- Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_

Now that you have taken back your ability to participate in our shared web by cultivating independent thought and thereby reclaiming your time, we can look together at the kinds of convivial institutions which might extend our ability to cooperate and live well together. To begin our exploration, we once more turn to Ivan Illich, who emphasises what is always at the heart of Kernel: **relationship**. We are here to increase the opportunity and desirability of human interaction; to facilitate not just coordination (shared system), and not just collaboration (shared values), but full and loving cooperation (shared purpose). The outcome of this human work can only be celebration (shared aliveness).   

Our focus on relationship and [reciprocity](/conversation/reciprocity) reflects an understanding that we are not here to burn down the current systems: such acts still participate in the coercive and violent structures presupposed by those very institutions. Instead, this week, we will try to understand what the principled refusal of tools and institutions which inculcate dependence might look like. We'll ask what it means to learn, or heal, or create, or move of our own accord, and how we can create networked institutions premised on spontaneous use rather than coercive force.

There is an old story known as <Link to="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">Chesterton's Fence</Link> which has many versions, the most popular of which includes an Englishman kicking down to the closed gate of a field he is walking through only to be trampled by the bull that gate was keeping enclosed. The moral is: don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand. Genuine insight - rather than contemptuous dismissal of the status quo - can only engender love, and it is love - not violence - which is the force capable of creating our social realities anew.

## Convivial Customs

Institutions need not be things like The Federal Reserve, or a government department, or a place you go when you need to spend some time separate from society. We have - for instance - the institution of marriage: which is a **practice** or a **custom**. It is in this sense which we will be using the word for the rest of Module 4.

This approach is similar to [extitutional theory](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53), which contrasts enclosure with the concept of **exclosure**, recognizing that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control. Understanding the practices and social customs that make up extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logic of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our era.

Routing information around slow-moving bureaucracies requires that we develop a deeper understanding of the many ways we can relate to one another and **organize ourselves**. In particular, the internet has caused - and will continue to cause - critical shifts in three spheres of human life: how we identify ourselves, how we reach consensus, and how we experience time. Cast in the language of anarchy - which really means no rulers, not no rules - these views of institution-as-practice or custom can be collected under the term <Link to="https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf">"counterpower"</Link>:

> Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ways of publicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and transforming it into social states (or if you like, forms of value) that society sees as the most desirable: conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity, beauty, however it may be framed.

In particular, we will make the claim this week that we can indeed [build for beauty](https://www.buildingbeauty.org/beautiful-software). We can co-create patterns which lead each one of us closer to the unhindered perception of what Christopher Alexander calls "true Self". In another classic interplay of complementary opposites, pattern languages which cultivate such intimately personal perception are inherently communal and, as such, lead us back to custom and conviviality. In concert with Alexander, we can turn back to Ivan Illich for an illuminating perspective on these critical words, **commons** and **custom**:

> The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. **Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.**
