Need we say more about why incentives matter?

## Persuasion

What constitutes persuasive language? Words which perform what they say. If an <Link to="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/smullyan.html">essay about humour</Link> is itself funny, then that essay is more likely to convince you about what humour is.

What happens when your code says, "Transfer 50 DAI to Alice" and executes the transfer of value simultaneously? Well, you can build really persuasive incentives for any kind of economic behaviour. How do we know what behaviour we should incentivize though?

## Economics in the computer age

Here's a [new kind of economic essay](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Economics.ipynb). What makes it interesting is that with a few lines of Python, Peter Norvig proves a surprising result about wealth inequality. The initial distribution of wealth in the economy doesn‚Äôt affect the long-run distribution of wealth nearly as much as the *nature of the [transactions](/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#signature-performances)*. His code also suggests that constraining agents to trade only with people geographically near them makes little difference to the final distribution of wealth.

Results like these challenge your intuition. But instead of those challenges being on the basis  of abstract arguments, you can engage his model. If you don‚Äôt agree that the initial distribution of wealth doesn‚Äôt affect long-run wealth inequality, you can try find a counterexample: an initial distribution which does affect inequality. You can experiment easily, making modifications to a few lines of code, trying to find instances where the initial distribution matters. No matter whether you succeed or fail, you will build a better understanding of the problem.

Used well, Jupyter notebooks become environments for transformative thought. They‚Äôre a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code. And that's just a notebook, let alone a smart contract. Such contracts deployed on a shared, global network not only demonstrate new economic insights and ideas, they **implement** them.

## Programming with purpose

You must <Link to="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/towards-a-practice-of-token-engineering-b02feeeff7ca">think like an engineer</Link> 
about the economic games your contracts incentivize. Ironically, the best place to go looking for clear thinking and research in this domain is neither economics, nor psychology. It is computer game design.

The reason for this is that contractual economic code on a shared, public ledger programs crowd behaviour. Don't get too excited by this, for with great power comes great responsibility - which is why the thinking patterns we outlined at the start of these modules have fundamentally to do with **[humility](/learn/module-3/humility/)**. You cannot, as an individual, know what the second and third order effects of such code will be. But you can be 
deeply aware that such effects exist, and you can use your awareness to inform the intention with which you write and deploy contracts.

Such intention is deeply linked to your [purpose](/learn/module-0/purpose/#full-brief): it is no coincidence that many educators use the term ["purpose-drive tokens"](https://github.com/Token-Economy-Book/EnglishOriginal/wiki/Purpose-Driven-Tokens). The purpose we can imbue our mechanisms with include reaching consensus on a network's state, contributing to lists, contributing to social media in various ways, and making it more expensive to pollute. 

This last point is most illustrative: simply buying carbon credits does not directly contribute to reducing emissions. However, it does drive the price of carbon credits up, which makes it more expensive for companies who pollute to offset such behaviour. Mechanisms are not only about whom we reward and how: we only favour that way of thinking due to the way incentives are programmed in Proof of Work blockchains, and because rewards are easier to market to the masses. When, instead, we realise that tokens are only scarce if we design them to be that way, then we can begin thinking more creatively about the sorts of cost models so critical to [censorship resistance](/learn/module-6/censorship-resistance/#economic-proof) on credibly neutral networks and the kinds of [balanced, collective incentive structures](/learn/module-6/serenity/#a-defenders-game) that can keep public goods both good and truly public.

This more balanced and integral approach leads us further into **software as service**. When we really serve others with purpose, the distinction between "them" and "me" begins to dissolve and we can begin to understand the inner meaning of phrases like, "We are all Satoshi".

Q: In order to implement economic games like responsible engineers, what internal state of mind must we cultivate?
