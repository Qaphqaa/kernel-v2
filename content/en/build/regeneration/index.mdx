# Regeneration

> ðŸ’¡ The Regeneration Guild is meant to be a guided onramp to the Web3 regeneration movement. ðŸŒ±.

The Regeneration guild is a series of workshops on life, growth, and thriving and is intended to help us all deepen our shared understanding of the regenerative movement, with a particular focus on its principles, values, and ethics.

Weâ€™ll be looking at everything from resilient resources to sacred economics as we explore tools, practices, and patterns which will help us live in balance, harmony, and health.
