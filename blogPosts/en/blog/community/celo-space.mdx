# Seeding Space with Celo

<InfoBlock>

_“Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together”_ – [Vincent van Gogh](/learn/module-0/purpose)

</InfoBlock>

Celo has very kindly offered all Kernel Fellows - past, present and future - access to their offices in San Francisco. We are delighted to make a physical space available as a part of this world wide garden of wisdom that is slowly growing between us.

You can find all the information you’ll need about the Celo space by clicking below:

We encourage any Kernel fellow who is either based in San Francisco, or who happens to pass through the bay on their travels, to take the time to go and meet some of the awesome people who tend to hang out at 500 Treat Avenue. It really is a treat.

Consider using this space for your next meet up, co-working sesh, or get in touch with us (link at the bottom) in order to propose your own event. Both Celo and Kernel would love to host you.

Celo has been an ongoing pillar of support for Kernel, and we have greatly enjoyed various interactions over the years. You can find some of the fireside chats we’ve hosted with Sep and Xochitl [here](/learn/module-2/engineering/#further-references). These conversations stand out as some of the most insightful and far-ranging discussions we’ve been lucky to participate in over the course of the last seven blocks.

Kernel Fellows who have become involved with Celo in various ways include Michael Keating (HERE Mobility), Elio Jordan Lopes (Into the Verse), Daryl Edwards (and ReFi DAO in general), En Canada (Black Magic Bank), Holly Grimm (Kolektivo), johnx25bd (Toucan), John Ellison and Nirvaan Ranganathan (Climate Collective), and many more. Jon Leland from Kickstarter has been working with Celo after going through Kernel. Kernel Fellows who work directly with the Celo Foundation or cLabs include Anna Kryukova, Nikhil Raghuveera, Will Le, Harpal Jadega, Lisa Li, Isabelle Wei, Isha Varshney, and Masha Healy.

Sharing physical space comes with a renewed, and slightly different, set of responsibilities if it is to be done in a wholesome and reciprocal manner. We’d like to remind you that Kernel Fellows are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/start/code-of-conduct) (at all times, and especially when receiving the kindness other communities extend to us). 

Moreover, Celo have their own [Values and Code of Conduct](https://clabsco.notion.site/Our-Community-7e5c923b1b514ca6b749a28d748aa19a) which sets the boundaries for the spaces they share, and if you are able to visit them, you will be expected to abide by that too.

> Watching the garden grow, and weave together different kinds of spaces in which we all participate, is a great honour for us at Kernel. We value relationships and diversity, and so could not be more excited to play a small part in opening the doors to a variety of different, intentional, and beautiful places we can all share with love and mutual care.
