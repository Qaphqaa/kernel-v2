The debate boils down to whether asking good questions in general is an ability best developed through disciplined exercise of rational skill, or the cultivation of \"beginner's mind\". In particular, techniques like <Link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method\" mdxType=\"Link\">the Socratic Method</Link> develop rational inquiry in order to fuel deeper, more intuitive understanding of a given topic. Corey writes:\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Experience and reflection, learning from our mistakes, and developing understanding all\nprovide nuance. A mechanic doesn't develop his ability to diagnose a problem solely from\nintrospection. It is through the combination of knowledge and understanding that intuition\narises. I've spent most of my life honing skills that give me broad and deep understanding for\nthe `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`specific purpose`}</em>{` of being able to ask good questions in any context.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`Or Justin B:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`I feel that knowledge of the specific, e.g. computer science, translates directly into\nintuition around the general.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`The mechanic or scientist's skill does grow more nuanced through acquisition of knowledge and\nskill by the exercise of discipline, and this does lead to more `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`specific`}</em>{` questions about\nutility. In this way, honing a skill leads to asking questions about that particular\ndiscipline, which is a good thing. So, let us add an 8th point:`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`8. Asking good questions requires a deep appreciation of context.`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`However, \"beginner's mind\" is not opposed to rational inquiry and the honing of skill: it is, in fact, the pinnacle of such discipline. Consider the `}<Link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Questioning_methods_in_Socratic_Circles\" mdxType=\"Link\">{`Socratic method`}</Link>{` more closely:`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questions are open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. The technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>{`Rational inquiry demands a diagnosis; a solution; an end to a process which had its beginning in the mind. What can such a mind do in the face of \"no single right answer\"? It can develop `}<Link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability\" mdxType=\"Link\">{`negative capability`}</Link>{`, but even this is insufficient, because we're not after skillful intellectual understanding: we seek harmonious and clear `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`ways of living`}</em>{`. And life is not only rational. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Accepting honestly your own limitations and inability to understand everything that happens around you creates the space within for curiosity. From here, you can genuinely enjoy never knowing what's going to happen next, which leads to asking questions which come from the heart and go to the heart of the subject being questioned.
