They represent meaningful facts which can be used to transmit information - to teach - in ways memes cannot, for two reasons. Firstly, memes need not be factual in the way tokens are (where ‘fact’ means a verifiable value on a public network). Secondly, memes propagate knowledge by virtue of when, how and where they are shared, though the act of sharing carries no explicit incentive. Because they represent a fact; holding, exchanging, buying or selling a token is a valuable action in a way sharing a meme is not.
