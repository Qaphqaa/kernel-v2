Instead, this week, we will try to understand what the principled refusal of tools and institutions which inculcate dependence might look like. We'll ask what it means to learn, or heal, or create, or move of our own accord, and how we can create networked institutions premised on spontaneous use rather than coercive force.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There is an old story known as `}<Link to=\"https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/\" mdxType=\"Link\">{`Chesterton's Fence`}</Link>{` which has many versions, the most popular of which includes an Englishman kicking down to the closed gate of a field he is walking through only to be trampled by the bull that gate was keeping enclosed. The moral is: don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand.

In another classic interplay of complementary opposites, pattern languages which cultivate such intimately personal perception are inherently communal and, as such, lead us back to custom and conviviality.
