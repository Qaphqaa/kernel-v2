But instead of those challenges being on the basis  of abstract arguments, you can engage his model. If you don't agree that the initial distribution of wealth doesn't affect long-run wealth inequality, you can try find a counterexample: an initial distribution which does affect inequality. You can experiment easily, making modifications to a few lines of code, trying to find instances where the initial distribution matters.

Ironically, the best place to go looking for clear thinking and research in this domain is neither economics, nor psychology.

However, it does drive the price of carbon credits up, which makes it more expensive for companies who pollute to offset such behaviour. Mechanisms are not only about whom we reward and how: we only favour that way of thinking due to the way incentives are programmed in Proof of Work blockchains, and because rewards are easier to market to the masses.
